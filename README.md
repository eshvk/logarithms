Unraveling Logarithms

## Text
Sometimes to make the harder things simpler, you have to make the simpler things harder. Vi Hart's fascinating video on Logarithms was something that I wanted to unravel. Fancy Counting. It is a story of addition, multiplication and exponentiation. Hover over the count steps to interact.


* Addition is where we all start. One potato, two potato, three potatoes. It is all a sequence of +1 steps. Count 3 steps of +1, get to 3. Obvious? Yes! Yet, we are trying to make the simpler things harder. So bear with me here. There are two key operations going on in this simple counting. The number of counts, the magnitude we get to by applying these number of counts.

* Multiplication makes this slightly more obvious. After all, it is still fancy counting, except that we count in different sized steps. No longer are we tied to +1s, we do +n, so counting 4 steps of +2, get you 8. 8 is also 8 steps on the +1 scale. So bigger steps but less number of steps.

* So where else do we go from here? Exponentiation. Now, the operation itself is different, each time we apply a x n, on a System That Counts in x2, 3 counts gives you 8. x 2 x 2 x2. In a STC x3, 4 counts gives you 81. x 3 x 3 x 3.

## Where do we go from here?

* Another obvious question, how many counts of +1 does it take to get to 3? Well, 3 duh!

* How many counts of +2 (or more generally +n) does it take to make 16? It is simply +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 or 8 steps. Or maybe, we look at the division function? 16/+2 is simply 8.

* So in a STC X3, how many counts gives you 81? logâ‚ƒ(81) = 4! This scale is the logarithmic scale!
